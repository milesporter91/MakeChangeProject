# Make Change Project

## Description
Welcome to my Java Cash Register! This program will take an input purchase amount, and input amount tendered, and output the amount of change due, as well as the denominations of the bills and coints due to the customer. 

To begin, run the program:
### Step 1: Input purchase price
### Step 2: Input amount paid
### Step 3: The Java Cash Register will return the change and count it for you, and ask if you would like to make another purchase.
### Step 4: To exit the program, please select no.
### Step 5: Program loops back to step 1, or outputs farewell message.

**NOTE:** Amount paid must be higher than the purchase price. If insufficient funds are supplied, the remaining balance will be told to the customer.
